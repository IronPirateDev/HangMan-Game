## ℹ️ How it Works
The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list or from an online API.
You can guess one letter at a time.
You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word.
The game displays the current state of the word, with blanks for unguessed letters.
If you guess a letter correctly, it will be revealed in the word.
If you guess incorrectly, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
## 🔄 API Integration
This version of the game integrates with the Random Word API to provide unlimited words. If you wish to use a different API, you can modify the choose_word() function accordingly.
